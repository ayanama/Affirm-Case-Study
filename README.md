**How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?**

* Levchin and his friend and co-founder, Nathan, were thinking about ways to build a new credit score. Affirm started off as being an idea to create a more accurate representation of a customer’s creditworthiness. They realized that banks would not lend to customers using their brand new credit model, so they decided to utilize their own credit model and underwriting process to create their own “buy now, pay later” lending product.

**How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?**

* The company is funded in multiple ways. One way is through securitizations, which is the packaging of loans into securities and selling them to investors. Most of their funding comes from selling loans that were not packaged into securities. This made up 49% of their funding mix for the first half of 2021, and brought in $2.3 billion. Initially, they relied on warehouse funding from lenders, which made up 42% of their lending mix in 2020, and 19% in 2021. They have no plans to take on additional corporate debt to fund the company.

Second, they exercise transparency by showing consumers the total cost of the loan before they accept it. Third, they do not charge late, penalty, or annual fee. Last, they allow customers to choose between a loan term of 3,6, or 12 months, and don’t penalize customers for early payoff.

    - Affirm utilizes machine learning during its underwriting process to write approvals and optimize payment options. Recently, Affirm added a new product to their suite called “Adaptive Checkout”. According to Affirm’s website, this new product provides customers with customized payment options based on transaction size, and Affirm’s real-time underwriting decision. 

- With Affirm’s proprietary technology, customers can receive approvals almost instantly. They just enter their personal information in order to receive the approval. Interestingly, Affirm’s underwriting approval tech looks at more than just their credit history to gauge financial responsibility. They also investigate a customer’s social media activity for additional cues into whether the customer is financially responsible.

### <ins>Recommendations:</ins>

**If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer?**

* If I were to advise this company, I would suggest that they offer personal finance education to their customers, as well as a budgeting extension to their app. There have been a number of critics that criticize companies like Affirm for taking advantage of low-income consumers that desperately need credit to make purchases. While these customers can benefit from being able to use this credit, critics fear that this newfound credit will cause them to go into deeper debt, allow them to layer themselves with more debt, and ultimately put them in a worse financial position than where they started. Providing access to financial education and budgeting for these customers can improve their decision-making. This education can be built into the app, and personalized based on the customer’s spending habits, income, assets, and goals. The budget app can provide incentives to reward customers for staying within their budget and reaching micro goals. 

**Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?**

* Offering this product would help the company to stave off critics and become a leader and blueprint to the rest of the domain. It will also increase the amount of successful loan payoffs, which will subsequently raise the value of those loans on the back end when sold to investors. These benefits also provide a direct benefit to the merchants who use Affirm as one of their point of sales payment options. As a result, more merchants would be willing to use Affirm as a payment option, increasing Affirm’s market share.

**What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?**

* The financial education and budgeting products can be automated using AI and Blockchain technology, keeping the process customizable, transparent, secure, and streamlined.

**Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?**

* AI and blockchain are technologies that can take customer information and make smart decisions based on the algorithms and coding of the platform. A program that customizes personal finance based on a customer’s habits will require this exact technology.
